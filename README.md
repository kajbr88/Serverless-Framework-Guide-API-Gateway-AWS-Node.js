# Serverless Framework Guide: API Gateway, AWS & Node.js

This repository contains the code and resources from the Udemy course "Serverless Framework Guide: API Gateway, AWS & Node.js" by Macaulay Academy.

## Course Overview

This course provides a comprehensive guide to building serverless applications using the Serverless Framework, AWS (Amazon Web Services), and Node.js. You will learn how to:

* Build a multi-store application with a fully serverless backend
* Implement microservices for better scalability and maintainability
* Use API Gateway, AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3 for a complete serverless stack
* Work with event-driven architectures using SQS, SNS, and EventBridge
* Automate deployments with Infrastructure as Code using Serverless Framework and AWS CloudFormation
* Implement authentication and authorization with Cognito and IAM
* Monitor and troubleshoot applications using CloudWatch and logging strategies
* Optimize performance, security, and cost efficiency for cloud-based applications

## Getting Started

To get started with the code in this repository, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

* **Node.js and npm (or yarn):** Ensure Node.js is installed on your system. npm usually comes bundled with Node.js. You can check your installation by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal.
* **Serverless Framework CLI:** Install the Serverless Framework command-line interface globally using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install -g serverless
    ```
    Or with yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn global add serverless
    ```
* **AWS Account:** You will need an active AWS account to deploy and run the serverless applications.
* **AWS CLI Configured:** Ensure the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is installed and configured with your AWS credentials. You can find instructions on how to do this in the AWS documentation.
